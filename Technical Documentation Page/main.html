                A programming language is a formal langauge comprising a
                set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.

                C++ is a general-purpose programming language created
                by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of C Programming
                language.

                C++ was designed with an orientation toward system 
                programming and embedded, resource-constrained 
                software and large systems, with performance, 
                efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design 
                highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in 
                many other contexts, with key strengths being software 
                rastructure and resource-constrained applications,
                including desktop applications, video games, servers 
                (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and

                Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun 
                Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle)
                 and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun
                  Microsystems' Java platform. The original and 
                  reference implementation Java compilers, virtual 
                  machines, and class libraries were originally 
                  released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of 
                  May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of
                   the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most 
                   its Java technologies under the GNU General Public
                    License.

                    <p>
                        Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[18][19] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.

              <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
            </header>
      
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming
              conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
              instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
              Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
              Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
      
            <p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based
              model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript
              programming.
            </p>
      
            <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in
              functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>
