    <h1>About Stan Lee :</h1>
    <p id="tribute-info">
      In 1939, a teenage Stan Lee began his career in comics and 
      75 years later, he is celebrated as the creative tour de 
      force behind Marvel’s Silver Age - the co-creator of 
      beloved characters like Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four,
      Hulk, Thor and the X-Men.
      Take part in Stan ‘The Man’ Lee’s historic legacy!
      Film adaptations based on the series that Lee cocreated 
      were highly successful. X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002)
      launched blockbuster franchises that earned billions of 
      dollars in box-office revenue worldwide. Other Lee creations 
      to receive the Hollywood treatment were Daredevil (2003), 
      Hulk (2003), and Iron Man (2008). Lee was often featured in
        cameo roles in those films, a tradition that continued 
        after Disney purchased Marvel in 2009.
        A flood of Marvel films followed the acquisition, 
        including those based on Lee-Kirby creations such as
        Thor (2011), the Avengers (2012), and Ant-Man (2015).
        Lee’s cameos became fan-favourite “Easter eggs” 
        within the Marvel Cinematic Universe—as the films’ 
        shared world came to be known—and he eventually 
        appeared in dozens of Marvel movies, television s
        hows, and video games. His brief role in Guardians 
        of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) clarified that Lee was, 
        in fact, portraying the same character in each of these
        appearances and that his recurring role has been that
        of a chronicler of the events of the Marvel Universe.
        In November 2002 Lee filed a $10 million lawsuit
        against Marvel after failing to receive any profits 
        from the first Spider-Man movie, and in 2005 the 
        court ruled in favour of Lee.
